# Flight Price Exploratory Data Analysis

Welcome to the Flight Price Exploratory Data Analysis project! In this project, I've performed an in-depth analysis of a flight price dataset to gain insights and uncover patterns that influence flight ticket prices. Additionally, I've utilized the Scikit-Learn library to preprocess the data, specifically focusing on encoding categorical variables.

## Introduction
The primary goal of this project is to delve into a flight price dataset and provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors that impact flight ticket prices. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques have been applied to visualize the data distribution, identify trends, and draw meaningful insights from it.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains information about various flight routes, travel durations, airline carriers, departure times, and more. It's crucial to understand the dataset's structure before diving into the analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
During the exploratory data analysis phase, I've performed the following tasks:
- Data visualization to understand the distribution of features
- Correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables and ticket prices
- Time-based analysis to explore price variations across different time periods
- Route-specific analysis to uncover pricing patterns for specific flight routes

## Preprocessing with Scikit-Learn
To prepare the dataset for analysis, I utilized Scikit-Learn's preprocessing libraries to handle categorical variables. Specifically, I employed techniques such as one-hot encoding and label encoding to transform categorical data into a suitable format for analysis and modeling.

## Usage
